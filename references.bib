	Abstract = {A number of laws are derived which establish relationships between throughput, response time, device utilization, space-time products and various other factors related to computer system performance. These laws are obtained through the operational method of computer system analysis. The operational method, which is formally introduced in this paper, differs significantly from the conventional stochastic modeling approach and is based on a set of concepts that correspond naturally and directly to observed properties of real computer systems. The operational laws presented in this paper apply with complete precision to all collections of observational data, and they are similar to fundamental laws found in other areas of engineering and applied science.},

abstract="Message-oriented event-driven systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many industry domains including telecommunications, transportation and supply chain management. Applications in these areas typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To guarantee adequate quality-of-service, systems must be subjected to a rigorous performance and scalability analysis before they are put into production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling methodology for message-oriented event-driven systems in the context of a case study of a representative application in the supply chain management domain. The methodology, which is based on queueing Petri nets, provides a basis for performance analysis and capacity planning. We study a deployment of the SPECjms2007 standard benchmark on a leading commercial middleware platform. A detailed system model is built in a step-by-step fashion and then used to predict the system performance under various workload and configuration scenarios. After the case study, we present a set of generic performance modeling patterns that can be used as building blocks when modeling message-oriented event-driven systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and accuracy of the proposed modeling and prediction approach.",

abstract="Message-oriented event-driven systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in many industry domains including telecommunications, transportation and supply chain management. Applications in these areas typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To guarantee adequate quality-of-service, systems must be subjected to a rigorous performance and scalability analysis before they are put into production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling methodology for message-oriented event-driven systems in the context of a case study of a representative application in the supply chain management domain. The methodology, which is based on queueing Petri nets, provides a basis for performance analysis and capacity planning. We study a deployment of the SPECjms2007 standard benchmark on a leading commercial middleware platform. A detailed system model is built in a step-by-step fashion and then used to predict the system performance under various workload and configuration scenarios. After the case study, we present a set of generic performance modeling patterns that can be used as building blocks when modeling message-oriented event-driven systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and accuracy of the proposed modeling and prediction approach.",
